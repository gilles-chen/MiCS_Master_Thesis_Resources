"1","Explain why arrays are used in dynamic programming.","Because they store data in a tabular format for efficient access.","Because they allow for dynamic resizing.","Because they store data in a tabular format for efficient access.","Because they support efficient insertions and deletions.","Because they are non-linear data structures."
"2","Describe the main difference between a stack and a queue.","A stack follows LIFO while a queue follows FIFO.","A stack follows FIFO while a queue follows LIFO.","A stack follows LIFO while a queue follows FIFO.","A stack allows random access while a queue does not.","A stack is a non-linear data structure while a queue is linear."
"3","Interpret the significance of using a hash table for fast lookups.","Hash tables provide O(1) time complexity for lookups on average.","Hash tables provide O(n) time complexity for lookups.","Hash tables provide O(1) time complexity for lookups on average.","Hash tables provide O(log n) time complexity for lookups.","Hash tables provide O(n^2) time complexity for lookups."
"4","Compare the time complexity of insertion in an array and a linked list.","Array has O(n) and linked list has O(1) time complexity.","Both have O(1) time complexity.","Array has O(n) and linked list has O(1) time complexity.","Array has O(1) and linked list has O(n) time complexity.","Both have O(n) time complexity."
"5","Explain the primary use of a priority queue.","To process elements based on their priority.","To store elements in a LIFO order.","To store elements in a FIFO order.","To process elements based on their priority.","To store elements in a tabular format."
"6","Describe the main characteristic of a binary search tree (BST).","Left child has a smaller value, right child has a greater value.","Each node has at most three children.","Each node has a value greater than its parent.","Left child has a smaller value, right child has a greater value.","Nodes are connected in a circular manner."
"7","Summarize the key operations of a stack.","Push, Pop, Peek","Enqueue, Dequeue, Peek","Insert, Delete, Search","Push, Pop, Peek","Insert, Delete, Traverse"
"8","Interpret the role of a root node in a tree data structure.","It is the topmost node from which all other nodes descend.","It is the node with the highest value.","It is the node with the lowest value.","It is the topmost node from which all other nodes descend.","It is a node with no children."
"9","Compare the traversal methods of a binary tree.","In-order, Pre-order, Post-order","In-order, Pre-order, Post-order","Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search","Linear, Non-linear","Sequential, Random"
"10","Explain the purpose of using a circular linked list.","To connect the last node back to the first node.","To allow random access to elements.","To connect the last node back to the first node.","To store elements in a tabular format.","To ensure each node has two pointers."
