"1","Explain why a binary search tree (BST) is more efficient than a linked list for search operations.","A BST allows for binary search, reducing the search time to O(log n) in a balanced tree.","A BST has a time complexity of O(n) for search operations.","A BST allows for binary search, reducing the search time to O(log n) in a balanced tree.","A BST uses more memory, making it faster.","A BST can store more elements than a linked list."
"2","Describe the main advantage of using a hash table over an array for storing data.","Hash tables provide constant time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations.","Hash tables can store more data than arrays.","Hash tables provide constant time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations.","Hash tables use less memory than arrays.","Hash tables maintain the order of elements."
"3","Summarize the key difference between a stack and a queue.","A stack follows Last In First Out (LIFO) order, while a queue follows First In First Out (FIFO) order.","A stack allows insertion at both ends, while a queue allows insertion at one end.","A stack follows Last In First Out (LIFO) order, while a queue follows First In First Out (FIFO) order.","A stack is used for breadth-first search, while a queue is used for depth-first search.","A stack can only store integers, while a queue can store any data type."
"4","Interpret the significance of the 'load factor' in a hash table.","It is the ratio of the number of elements to the number of buckets.","It determines the maximum number of elements a hash table can store.","It indicates the average number of elements per bucket.","It measures the efficiency of the hash function.","It is the ratio of the number of elements to the number of buckets."
"5","Compare and contrast an array and a linked list in terms of memory allocation.","Arrays use contiguous memory allocation, while linked lists use non-contiguous memory allocation.","Arrays use dynamic memory allocation, while linked lists use static memory allocation.","Arrays use contiguous memory allocation, while linked lists use non-contiguous memory allocation.","Arrays and linked lists both use contiguous memory allocation.","Arrays use non-contiguous memory allocation, while linked lists use contiguous memory allocation."
"6","Explain the purpose of a priority queue and how it differs from a regular queue.","A priority queue processes elements based on their priority, not just their order of arrival.","A priority queue allows elements to be inserted at both ends.","A priority queue processes elements based on their priority, not just their order of arrival.","A priority queue is always implemented using a linked list.","A priority queue can only store integer values."
"7","Describe the main characteristic of a circular linked list.","The last node points back to the first node, forming a circle.","It has a fixed number of nodes.","The last node points back to the first node, forming a circle.","It allows for bidirectional traversal.","It uses a hash function to manage nodes."
"8","Interpret the role of the 'head' pointer in a singly linked list.","It points to the first node in the list.","It points to the last node in the list.","It points to the first node in the list.","It points to the middle node in the list.","It points to the node with the highest value."
"9","Summarize the key advantage of using a doubly linked list over a singly linked list.","Doubly linked lists allow for traversal in both directions.","Doubly linked lists use less memory.","Doubly linked lists allow for traversal in both directions.","Doubly linked lists are easier to implement.","Doubly linked lists have a simpler node structure."
"10","Explain the concept of 'recursion' in the context of data structures.","Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem.","Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem.","Recursion is a method of sorting data in a list.","Recursion is a way to traverse a graph using a stack.","Recursion is a technique to allocate memory dynamically."
