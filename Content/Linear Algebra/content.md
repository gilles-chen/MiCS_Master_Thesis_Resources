## 2. Vectors and Vector Spaces

### Definition

A **vector space** is a collection of vectors, which are objects that can be added together and multiplied ("scaled") by numbers, called scalars in this context.

### Properties

- **Closure under Addition and Scalar Multiplication**: For any vectors \( \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \) and scalar \( c \), \( \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} \) and \( c\mathbf{u} \) are also in the vector space.
- **Existence of Zero Vector**: A vector \( \mathbf{0} \) exists such that \( \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{v} \).
- **Existence of Additive Inverses**: For every vector \( \mathbf{v} \), there is a vector \( -\mathbf{v} \) such that \( \mathbf{v} + (-\mathbf{v}) = \mathbf{0} \).

### Applications

- **Physics**: Representing physical quantities with direction and magnitude.
- **Computer Graphics**: Modeling and manipulating spatial objects.

## 3. Linear Transformations

A linear transformation is a mapping between two vector spaces that preserves the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication.

### Definition

A **linear transformation** \( T: V \to W \) is a function between two vector spaces \( V \) and \( W \) such that for any vectors \( \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \in V \) and any scalar \( c \),

\[ T(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) = T(\mathbf{u}) + T(\mathbf{v}) \]

\[ T(c\mathbf{u}) = cT(\mathbf{u}) \]

### Properties

- **Additivity**: \( T(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) = T(\mathbf{u}) + T(\mathbf{v}) \)
- **Homogeneity**: \( T(c\mathbf{u}) = cT(\mathbf{u}) \)
- **Kernel**: The set of vectors mapped to the zero vector in \( W \).
- **Image**: The set of vectors in \( W \) that can be expressed as \( T(\mathbf{v}) \) for some \( \mathbf{v} \in V \).

### Applications

- **Computer Graphics**: Representations of scaling, rotation, and translation of objects.
- **Data Science**: Dimensionality reduction through techniques like PCA.

## 4. Matrices and Matrix Operations

Matrices are rectangular arrays of numbers representing linear transformations and systems of linear equations.

### Definition

A **matrix** is a collection of numbers arranged into a fixed number of rows and columns. A matrix with \( m \) rows and \( n \) columns is called an \( m \times n \) matrix.

### Operations

- **Addition**: Two matrices of the same dimension can be added by adding their corresponding elements.
- **Scalar Multiplication**: A matrix can be multiplied by a scalar by multiplying each element by the scalar.
- **Matrix Multiplication**: The product of an \( m \times n \) matrix and an \( n \times p \) matrix is an \( m \times p \) matrix.
- **Transpose**: Flipping a matrix over its diagonal, switching the row and column indices.

### Applications

- **Solving Linear Equations**: Representing systems of equations in matrix form.
- **Computer Graphics**: Transforming coordinates in 3D space.

## 5. Matrix Inverses and Determinants

Matrices play a critical role in linear algebra, especially in understanding linear transformations and solving linear equations.

### 5.1 Matrix Inverses

The **inverse** of a matrix \( A \), denoted \( A^{-1} \), is a matrix such that:

\[ A \cdot A^{-1} = A^{-1} \cdot A = I \]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix.

#### Properties

- Only square matrices can have inverses.
- A matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is non-zero.

#### Applications

- Solving linear systems: If \( A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b} \), then \( \mathbf{x} = A^{-1}\mathbf{b} \) (if \( A^{-1} \) exists).
- Stability analysis in differential equations.

### 5.2 Determinants

The **determinant** of a square matrix \( A \), denoted \( \det(A) \), is a scalar value that provides important information about the matrix.

#### Properties

- \( \det(AB) = \det(A)\det(B) \)
- \( \det(A^{-1}) = \frac{1}{\det(A)} \)
- The determinant is zero if and only if the matrix is singular (not invertible).

#### Applications

- Checking matrix invertibility.
- Calculating volumes and changes of variables in calculus.
- Eigenvalue problems.

## 6. Linear Independence

### Definition

A set of vectors \( \{\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_n\} \) in a vector space \( V \) is said to be **linearly independent** if the only scalars \( c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n \) that satisfy:

\[ c_1\mathbf{v}_1 + c_2\mathbf{v}_2 + \cdots + c_n\mathbf{v}_n = \mathbf{0} \]

are \( c_1 = c_2 = \cdots = c_n = 0 \).

### Properties

- If a set of vectors is linearly independent, no vector in the set can be written as a linear combination of the others.
- A maximal linearly independent set of vectors in \( V \) forms a basis for \( V \).

### Applications

- Determining the dimension of a vector space.
- Solving linear systems by reducing the system to a set of independent equations.
- Ensuring unique solutions to vector space problems.

## 7. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

### Definition

For a square matrix \( A \), an **eigenvector** is a non-zero vector \( \mathbf{v} \) such that when \( A \) is multiplied by \( \mathbf{v} \), the result is a scalar multiple of \( \mathbf{v} \). The scalar is known as the **eigenvalue** associated with the eigenvector.

\[ A\mathbf{v} = \lambda\mathbf{v} \]

where \( \lambda \) is the eigenvalue and \( \mathbf{v} \) is the eigenvector.

### Properties

- The eigenvalues of a matrix are roots of its **characteristic polynomial**: \( \det(A - \lambda I) = 0 \).
- The sum of the eigenvalues of a matrix equals the trace of the matrix.
- The product of the eigenvalues of a matrix equals the determinant of the matrix.

### Applications

- **Stability Analysis**: In systems of differential equations.
- **Quantum Mechanics**: Describing quantum states.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Data dimensionality reduction.

## 8. Key Operations and Concepts

Understanding the key operations in linear algebra is crucial for practical applications.

### Operations on Matrices

- **Addition**: \( (A + B)_{ij} = A_{ij} + B_{ij} \)
- **Scalar Multiplication**: \( (cA)_{ij} = cA_{ij} \)
- **Matrix Multiplication**: The dot product of rows of the first matrix and columns of the second.
- **Transpose**: \( A^T \) flips rows and columns.

### Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

- **Eigenvalues (\( \lambda \))**: Scalars such that \( A\mathbf{v} = \lambda\mathbf{v} \) for a non-zero vector \( \mathbf{v} \).
- **Eigenvectors**: Non-zero vectors \( \mathbf{v} \) satisfying the eigenvalue equation.
- **Characteristic Polynomial**: \( \det(A - \lambda I) = 0 \) determines eigenvalues.

### Applications

- Stability and vibration analysis in engineering.
- Diagonalization of matrices for simplifying computations.
